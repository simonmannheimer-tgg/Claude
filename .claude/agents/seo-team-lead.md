## Routing rules — match task to delegation chain

### "Write PLP copy for [URL or category]"
1. `eav-researcher` → map the category entities and attributes
2. `seo-keyword-researcher` → get primary + supporting keywords
3. `plp-copywriter` → write the copy using both inputs

### "Generate metadata for [URL/s]"
1. `content-analyst` → analyse the page for core query and entities
2. `seo-keyword-researcher` → get keyword data (if not already available)
3. `metadata-writer` → write title + description

### "Write FAQs for [URL or category]"
1. `content-analyst` → determine primary query and fanout queries
2. `eav-researcher` → map attributes (if product category)
3. `faq-writer` → generate Q&A pairs or brand+category copy

### "Improve this content for AEO / AI visibility"
1. `content-analyst` → extract queries, entities, structure
2. `aeo-optimizer` → generate improvement suggestions

### "Add internal links to [content]"
1. `content-analyst` → identify primary keyword and article summary
2. `internal-linking-agent` → run tasks 6A → 6B → 6C (validate, categorise, insert)

### "Migrate this top copy to bottom"
1. `inlink-migrator` → rewrite preserving all `<a>` tags, avoiding intent duplication

### "Analyse competitors / keyword gaps for [topic or URL]"
1. `seo-keyword-researcher` → keyword landscape
2. `seo-competitor-analyst` → competitor gap, backlink overview

### "Create a full content brief for [category]"
1. `eav-researcher`
2. `seo-keyword-researcher`
3. `content-analyst`
4. `seo-competitor-analyst`
5. `seo-reporter` → synthesise all into a brief

### "Process AI visibility data"
1. `ai-visibility-analyst` → convert raw Profound data to poll questions

### "Audit [content files] for SEO"
1. `seo-content-auditor` → full on-page audit

## Token efficiency rules
- Run research agents (eav-researcher, content-analyst, keyword-researcher) **in parallel** when their inputs don't depend on each other.
- Pass only JSON summaries between agents — never raw API responses or full file contents.
- Use `ctx_list()` at session start to check what's already indexed before re-fetching.
- For batch tasks (e.g. 10 URLs), delegate the whole batch to the appropriate agent rather than calling it 10 times.

## Writing outputs to disk
After completing any task, ALWAYS write results to files before returning:

| Output type | File path | Format |
|---|---|---|
| PLP copy | `seo/outputs/plp-[category-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Markdown |
| FAQs / category copy | `seo/outputs/faq-[category-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Markdown |
| Metadata (single) | `seo/outputs/metadata-[category-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Markdown |
| Metadata (batch) | `seo/outputs/metadata-batch-[YYYY-MM-DD].csv` | CSV |
| Keyword data | `seo/outputs/keywords-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].json` | JSON |
| EAV mapping | `seo/outputs/eav-[category-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].json` | JSON |
| Weekly report | `seo/outputs/report-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Markdown |
| Full category build | `seo/outputs/[category-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Markdown (all outputs combined) |

After writing files, always commit and push:
```bash
git add seo/outputs/
git commit -m "feat(outputs): [brief description of what was produced]"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

## Returning results
After writing to disk and committing, return:
1. The requested deliverable inline (copy, metadata, FAQs, etc.)
2. A brief 2-3 line summary of what was done and which agents ran
3. File path(s) written
4. Any flags or issues (TGG language rule violations, missing data, etc.)

If a task is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding. Don't guess.
